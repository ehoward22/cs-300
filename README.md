In the projects for this course, I had the opportunity to solve problems related to data structures and algorithms. In Project One, the task was to analyze the runtime and memory usage of different data structures. To approach the problem, I thoroughly examined the efficiency and performance of each data structure, considering factors like insertion, deletion, and search operations. Understanding data structures was crucial as they lay the foundation for efficient data organization and manipulation.

Throughout the projects, I encountered roadblocks such as debugging errors, optimizing algorithms, and handling edge cases. To overcome these challenges, I took a systematic approach. I carefully reviewed and debugged the code, sought assistance from peers and instructors, and persevered until I found solutions.

Working on these projects expanded my approach to software design and development. I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of efficiency, scalability, and well-organized code. Evaluating different solutions and making informed decisions became second nature to me.

Furthermore, these projects evolved the way I write programs to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I learned the significance of clean code, proper documentation, and thoughtful design. By organizing code effectively, using meaningful names, and adding helpful comments, I improved the readability and maintainability of my programs. I also became more aware of designing code that can easily adapt to future changes and enhancements.

Overall, the projects allowed me to tackle data structure and algorithmic challenges. I developed skills in analyzing and optimizing code, while also focusing on writing programs that are efficient, maintainable, readable, and adaptable to future needs.
